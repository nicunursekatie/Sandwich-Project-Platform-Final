 * Staffing format parser and generator

 * Format specifications:
 * - The staffing column contains role assignments separated by role prefixes
 * - Format: "D: Name1, Name2, S: Name3, V: Name4, VD: Name5"
 * - Each role can have multiple people assigned (comma-separated names)
 * - Each role can be:
 *   - Assigned with name(s): "D: John Doe, Jane Smith" (role needed, assigned to John and Jane)
 *   - Unassigned but needed: "D:" or "D: " (role needed but no one assigned)
 *   - Not needed: role is omitted from the string
 *
 * Roles:
 * - D: Driver (regular)
 * - VD: Van Driver (special type of driver, checked before D)
 * - S: Speaker
 * - V: Volunteer
 *
 * Examples:
 * - "D: John Doe, S: Jane Smith" = Driver assigned to John, Speaker assigned to Jane
 * - "D: John, Jane, S: Bob" = Drivers assigned to John AND Jane, Speaker assigned to Bob
 * - "D:, S:" = Driver and Speaker needed but unassigned
 * - "VD: Bob Jones, V:" = Van Driver assigned to Bob, Volunteer needed but unassigned
 * - "" = No roles needed
 *
 * Note: When parsing, VD must be checked before D to avoid false matches.
 * Note: Unassigned positions may include trailing space after colon (e.g., "D: ").
 * Note: Comma-separated names within a role are preserved as a single string.
