UI Implementation Instructions:

Group permissions by category with collapsible sections (like shown above)
Use clear icons for each category
Add descriptive help text under each permission explaining what it includes
Color-code danger levels:

🟢 Green: Basic permissions (view, submit own)
🟡 Yellow: Elevated permissions (manage others' content)
🔴 Red: Admin permissions (system-breaking potential)


Auto-bundling logic:

When "Submit collections" is checked → automatically enable edit/delete own
When any chat is enabled → automatically enable edit/delete own messages in that chat
Make the bundled permissions visible but greyed out so users understand what's included


Special rules to enforce:

Work logs: Users can only ever see their own EXCEPT those with "View ALL work logs"
Direct messages: NO edit/delete after sending for anyone except full deletion by admin
System Admin: Add a warning modal "This grants complete system access. Are you sure?"


Add permission presets dropdown:

Basic Volunteer (collections + general chat)
Host Team Member
Recipient Team Member
Driver Team Member
Core Team Member
Team Lead
Administrator


Search/filter functionality to quickly find specific permissions
Show permission count next to each user (e.g., "Sarah (12 permissions)")
Audit log for permission changes (who changed what, when)
